# Adaptive-Quiz

The Adaptive Quiz is our proposed model that admin to carry quiz according to the student’s intellectual level which means an adaptive style quiz. As the student attempts the quiz an algorithm uses a formula to choose questions and estimate the student’s ability within a certain amount of error. Adaptive quiz is a website which deals with web based MCQs of PHP coding languages. The adaptive quiz requires the use of both question bank categories and tags, in order to determine the questions that will be displayed during an individual user's attempt. Tags are used to assign the questions difficulty levels. Then categories of questions can be assigned to the adaptive quiz question table. The activity parameters allow the instructor to determine the difficulty levels of questions available for the quiz. A starting level is selected for the first question and then the student’s previous response to the quiz selects the next difficulty level for a question to be chosen from. If the student answers a question correctly, a more challenging question is chosen next. If the student answers a question incorrectly, a less challenging question is chosen next. During the start of an attempt the number of questions is specified which is ten. The amount of questions presented will be between a maximum number of questions set in the activity parameter.  After the maximum number of questions have been answered, the quiz will stop when the user's ability level is determined to the required accuracy or the quiz stops when the maximum number of questions have been answered. This System is developed for educational purpose allowing the user to prepare the Multiple Choices Questions for different examination conducted on provisional and national level and also for increasing their programming Knowledge.

OBJECTIVES OF STUDY
Among the objectives of this project work, are:-
To creatively construct new method for quiz; (adaptive quiz)
Effective and efficient timely report
To demonstrate the concept, ethics, methods and effectiveness of a computerized quiz
To build mental alertness for students
To increase level of smartness among the students.

Working-

We develop Adaptive quiz as our mini-project for semester III. Our team had tried to provide question which will get students clear about the basic knowledge of respective programming language which is PHP. But our model is  not like that traditional type of quiz but is depends on the intellectual level of students. So the difficulty levels increases as the students giving right answers consistently.

Starting with the first page of our website it display panels of admin and user who wants to gave the quiz. When user click on the user panel it redirects user to the user page where a detailed information shows all the guidelines and rules that should be followed or considered while attempting quiz. After going through it and accepting those rule user can click on the start button where actual quiz will start.

There are total 10 questions provided in quiz. In database there are 10-10 question of level 0 and level 1 in each database. According to the response given by the user the next question will be pick from any one of them. There are four options provided to each question, out of which only one option is correct. Total score will be calculated after the completion of quiz on the basis        of the correct option selected. This score will be calculated at the end of the quiz. The final score result of the quiz will be stored in the database.
